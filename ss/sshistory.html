                <h1>Lloyd Shapley</h1>
                
                <p> Lloyd Shapley was both a mathematician and an economist who won a Nobel Prize. His main contribution was game theory, with the Shapley-Shubik power index backing up 
                many of the modern-day power calculations. He was born on June 2nd, 1923, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In his early life, he attended both Phillips Exeter Academy and 
                Harvard, then went on to serve the United States Army in China. His most notable achievement in the military was receiving a Bronze Star for breaking the Soviet 
                weather code. After the war, he went back to school, eventually receiving his Ph.D. from Princeton University. He continued his work in game theory at the RAND 
                Corporation and eventually as a professor at UCLA. He died on March 12,  2016, at 92 years old from a broken hip. </p>

                <h1>Martin Shubik</h1>

                <p>Martin Shubik was a mathematical economist that also specialized in game theory, as well as defense analysis and monetary economics. 
                Shubik was born on March 23th, 1926, in Manhattan, New York. At just 3 months old, he returned to England and began school there. During WWII, he was sent to 
                Canada to avoid the war. In order to begin college at the University of Toronto in Canada during the war, he was forced to join the Royal Canadian Navy. There, 
                he receive both a BA in Mathematics and MA in Political Economy. After UT, he went on to study at Princeton University to receive an AM and PHD. This is were he 
                met his future  partner in the Shapley-Shubik power index, Lloyd Shapley. Coincidentally, they were roommates. In 1954, Shubik and Shapley devised the 
                Shapley-Shubik power index. From there, Shubik spent time as a consultant and expert witness for many locations, as well as working with Shapley in the RAND 
                Corporation. From 1963-2007, he spend his time at Yale.  Martin Shubik died on Augstust 22, 2018. </p>
