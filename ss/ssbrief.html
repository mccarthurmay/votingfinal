            <div class="history"> <p>The Shapley-Shubik power index was created by Lloyd Shapley and Martin Shubik in 1954. 
                Their objective was to measure the power of individuals in committee-like voting systems. This is done so in a voting game sort-of style, 
                where legislative bodies, shareholders,  individual legislators, senators, etc. can be represented by a “player.”  This strategy has been 
                used to analyze the voting power in the Council of the European Union, as well as the United Nations Security Council. It was determined 
                that the power index of a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council was .18648%, while the power index of a permanent member was 19.62704%. </p> </div>
