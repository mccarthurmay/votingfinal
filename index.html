                a yes/no voting system by observing <mark>pivotal*</mark>
                 voters. To determine the Shapley-Shubik power of a voter, the number of 
                arrangements with all voters in the system where the voter is pivotal is counted. The total Shapley-Shubik power is 
                calculated by finding the total number of arrangements of all voters in the system. Finally, the Shapley-Shubik index 
                is calculated by dividing a voter's Shapley-Shubik power by the system's total Shapley-Shubik power. <br>
