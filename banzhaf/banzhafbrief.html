            <div class="history"> <p>The Banzhaf power index was created by John F. Banzhaf III in 1965 to prove that the Nassau County boardâ€™s voting system was unfair to all the 
                districts within the county. As we saw with Practice Question #1, we were left with 3 districts holding no power in the vote. Banzhaf was able to argue that a 
                voting arrangement with no power while still having 16% of the population is unfair.</p> </div>
