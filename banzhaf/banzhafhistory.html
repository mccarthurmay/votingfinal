            <div class="bighistory"> <p>John F. Banzhaf III works as a professor and practices public interest law. Interestingly enough, he is considered the “Ralph Nader of the 
                Tobacco Industry”. He was born on July 2nd, 1940. At the age of 15, he graduated from Manhattan’s Stuyvesant High School and continued on to the Massachusetts 
                Institute of Technology. He graduated from MIT with a BA in electrical engineering, then from Columbia Law School with a Doctor of Law. Besides innovating the 
                Shapley-Shubik power index, as a college student, he also became the first person to have legal protection implemented on computer software. He had a huge battle 
                against Tobacco with his non-profit group called Action on Smoke and Health. He was able to win over the FCC by arguing that if tobacco advertisements are 
                broadcasting pro-smoking messages, the broadcasters should also show an equal amount of anti-smoking messages. The tobacco industry tried to fight back, but 
                the US Supreme Court declined the case. To prevent anti-smoking messages, the tobacco industry stopped showing ANY advertisements. Banzhaf also had a battle 
                against obesity, criticizing that soft drink machines were allowed in school, as well as McDonald’s contribution to child obesity. He brought a lot of attention 
                to McDonald’s by claiming that they have false advertisement that contributes to childhood obesity. Finally, Banzhaf fought with Nassau County Board’s voting system, 
                claiming how it was unfair. He now works as a professor at George Washington University. </p> </div>
