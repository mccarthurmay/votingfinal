                <p>J. Deegan Jr. and Edward Packel wanted to create a system that can be more broadly used than Banzhaf and Shapley-Shubik’s systems. The Deegan-Packel solution
                 is able to generalize the power index and axioms provided to a broader group of situations. The new generalized version of a power index can now be extended to more complicated 
                 situations with different rules and characteristics applied, which Banzhaf and Shapley-Shubik may not be able to reach. The Deegan Packel index chooses to depend on the number of
                  <mark>minimal winning coalitions*</mark>. Every voter within the minimal winning coalition gains a point. 
                Each individual voter’s points are then divided by the total number of points in the system to get an individual’s Deegan-Packel power index.
